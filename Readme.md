## Rafty

**Disclaimer: This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used in production systems.**


Rafty is a toy implementation of the raft consensus algorithm with a key value database on top.
It is designed for educational purposes to help understand the inner workings of the Raft algorithm and also how to build a distributed key-value store.

This implementation is not intended for production use and may lack the robustness, security, and performance optimizations required for real-world applications.

It is loosely based on the original Raft paper: [In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm (Extended Version)](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf).
